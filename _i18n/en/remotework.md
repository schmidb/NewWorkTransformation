2020 was a year unlike any other. Rather than slow us down, 2020 accelerated our shift to a digital world and we anticipate we won’t go back any time soon. 2021 will follow in the footsteps of 2020 and we have to deal with home office for adults as well for children. This gives us a lot of challenges for companies as for each individual as for each family.

Markus and I have a lot of experiences with these challenges. Since the birth of our first
son in 2009 Miriam is working in home office with her son at home. Since 2019 we (part of us at least) are a traveling
family with homeschooler children. Since two years both of us are working partly from
home (Markus still worked in an office when it was possible) with children at home and
gathered a lot of experience with exactly those challenges which we all face now due to the new Corona regulations.

Starting early 2021 we offer our knowledge in form of 3 different options:

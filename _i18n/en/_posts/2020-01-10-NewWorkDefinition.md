For us, New Work stands for a corporate culture that offers its employees an environment in which they are motivated to give their best performance based on their skills and largely independently.

For the company this has many important advantages for the future:
<ul>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> efficiently working employees </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> reduced employee turnover </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> more flexible and therefore shorter reaction times to changes in the market thanks to the high level of personal responsibility of the employees </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> fewer sick days for employees </li>
</ul>

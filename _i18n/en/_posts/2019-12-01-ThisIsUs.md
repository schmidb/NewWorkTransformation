We share our path and ours openly and honestly
Transformation processes from children to adults to parents and authentic
People with new ways of working.

Our goal is an open, honest and authentic relationship with each other as a couple and with our children. That doesn't work every day. We make mistakes and want to learn from them again. An honest and constructive relationship with each other as a couple and with our children helps us.


## Miriam
I grew up as the eldest child in a large Bavarian family of six and went through the classic educational path through high school, studying computer science and started and unfinished doctorates.

My driving force is the vision of a "family as a cooperative community" in which everyone lives together voluntarily and it is pleasant for everyone. In addition, there is the dream that, as the mother of several children, I will have my own life (e.g. my own job, my own trips, ...) and that part of me will also have space.

This is where I see my greatest challenge, as this does not correspond to classic parenting. Together with Markus, I also had to find out that this doesn't work in a classic employee relationship and so I stopped working in 2014.

Until then, I also pursued my great professional interest in "How do people work" and researched it. My specialty was the collaboration between teams and management in software development. The decisive factor here is not the perfect method, but the human interaction and how people treat one another. A software team e.g. requires a scrummaster or, as in the classic family, a "mom" who recognizes, feels and stabilizes interpersonal relationships. Without someone with the right emphatic skills, the team doesn't work.

I discovered the same thing for my own life. There is not one method that is right for every family. Each method has its own contribution to our life. New methods inspire me and give me new impulses for my own life.

A large family together as a community of cooperation and space for every family member is my vision. Me and my family are still learning and getting there.


## Markus
I grew up as an only child in a small Bavarian family and successfully mastered the classic educational path through high school, mathematics studies and a doctorate. From a professional perspective, I now manage a large software development department with over 40 employees at one of the leading German online platforms.

I met Miriam in 2002 and quickly realized that Miriam was giving me something that I hadn't known before. With our wedding in March 2007, a long process of learning and exploring myself began:
<ul>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> I was allowed to learn to argue - something I didn't know before </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> I learned to perceive anger and aggression and to deal with it </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> And I got to know many new feelings or let them roll over me. </li>
</ul>

In 2009 we had our first son Benjamin and in 2011 our second son Noah. That brought us from being a couple to being a parent very quickly. In addition to my constant knowledge of myself, this has presented me with new challenges and thrown me off track a few times. Switching from full-time to part-time (80%) gave me the space I needed to continue learning myself. I still work part-time to this day and still have a career.

The connection to Miriam and the feeling that she gives me something special has never been lost. Motivated by this positive enrichment in my life, I left the path of classical therapy in 2014 and explored a lot of new things through alternative therapies and seminars:

Family constellations, radical permission seminars, radical honesty seminars, nonviolent communication seminars, self-compassion workshops, heart work, ... have helped me to be more conscious and authentic in life and to take responsibility for myself and my family.

Even today I am still looking for "the right" path in life. I see my strength in always trying out and going new ways. The focus is on the search for "the perfect" way out of a relationship with myself, with my wife Miriam, my children and my work.

I have taken many stumbling blocks with me over the past 15 years. Today and in the future I would like to share my experiences with interested people and open our eyes to the many possibilities that we can pursue towards a better family life.

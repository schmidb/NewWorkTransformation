Working from home with children is a completely different situation than working alone at home or in the office with adult colleagues. The most important thing is your own inner attitude: CHILDREN BEFORE WORK. That means both are important, but the children are more important.

For us, home office is working from home. In Germany, among others also the term telework or home work application. This type of work is of course only possible for certain work activities and is especially common in the IT industry.


#### As a general rule
Possibly the statement "children before work" already triggers resistance ("Stop - but we can't finance our life without my work." Or similar), despair ("How can I do that, I'll never do my job." or similar) or a feeling of impossibility.
Then take a cup of tea or a glass of water and time to listen to the thoughts, maybe write them down, and at the same time observe your feelings. Take yourself seriously and at the same time make yourself aware that you are and can do more. Focus on your breath and remember all the challenges that you have already mastered.
That's exactly what it is here: a challenge with a great opportunity to strengthen the bond between you and your children.

A first practical trick is to make the information that seems important to you or something that you want to try new clearly visible at the workplace. For example, stick a piece of paper with “KINDER BEFORE WORK” in the center of the field of vision.


**Age and individual skills** <br>
For everything else, the age and individual abilities of the children must be taken into account. We roughly divide into children under 6 and children from 6.
The processes described are long-term measures that initially seem to require a lot of time, energy and attention, but in our experience pay off in that they both strengthen the family bond and actually create space for stress-free work from home with the children present.

**Short term solution vs. long-term change** <br>
Are you only concerned with a few exceptions, such as Only 2 or 3 days, and you have no long-term interest in working from home (or simply time for your own projects with children at home), then you can also use tricks like watching your favorite film, listening to radio plays, organizing babysitting, at bedtime work, occupy with special food or help out.

And another note for readers from the software development or IT industry: Our approach "children before work" is in the same sense as the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/){: target = "blank"} says “Individuals and interaction over processes and tools”.


#### Home office with children under 6 years
“Home office with children under 6 years” describes our approach to how it is possible to give priority to children's needs and still be able to work. This includes two parts: On the one hand, attentively observing the child's needs and creating a permanent, stress-free and relaxed attitude.

**Why do I need a stress-free and relaxed attitude** <br>
Stress always transfers to my surroundings. Especially on our children, as they are dependent on us. Our stress puts the children under pressure, which each child deals with individually. Examples of child behavior under pressure are:
<ul>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> Resistance: nothing is right anymore and there is no more willingness to cooperate </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> Accidents: the full glass tips over, the child pees, hurts, ... </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> Fear or insecurity: suddenly the child can no longer dress, eat, go to the toilet, ... </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> Call for attention with "is the picture beautiful?", "is the putty so right?", "the putty figure will not succeed", ... </li>
  <li style = "list-style-type: disc;"> Ailments: the stomach hurts, diarrhea, earache,, ... </li>
</ul>
If I am relaxed as a parent, then my child can relax too. But it doesn't have to be. Children can also have their own stress.

**How do I know if I am already stressed?** <br>
![Stressbarometer](/assets/images/stressbaro.jpg){:class="materialboxed"}{:width"=250"}{:style="float:right;margin-left: 10px;"}
At the [TransParents Workshops](http://www.transparents.net){: target = "blank"} - which I attended Markus - a stress barometer is suggested to visualize your stress level on a scale of 0-10: 0 means relaxed, 10 maximum stress. At first, using the barometer takes a lot of practice. We have found that having a regular reminder and ritual is helpful. e.g. Close your eyes every 30 minutes, just observe your breath for 5 breaths and then determine your stress level. Today the stress barometer hangs on a whiteboard in the kitchen and it catches my eye with every meal and I, Markus, determine my current stress level.

We have also observed that in the beginning our own assessment of stress was often lower than it actually was. How do I know that I am fooling myself? The easiest way is through external feedback. In this case, through the behavior of my children. If they already show behaviors that I have observed in them in tense situations, I can be sure that my stress level is 2-3 levels higher.

The recommendation at TransParents is **to stop everything at 8 or higher**, to sit on the floor and to devote yourself fully to getting out of stress. In this case, communicating your stress level to the children is very helpful. The children then understand why an action is being canceled and the children sitting down on the floor and next to the parent is immediately relaxing for the children as well.

**What is the purpose of mindful observation of the child's needs** <br>
In addition to your own stress-free and relaxed attitude, careful observation of the child's needs is a very important point. If my child feels comfortable and safe, he can relax and pursue his own interests and I have space to e.g. Work.

I.e. Throughout the day I observe when and in which situations my child shows through their behavior that they need something. I can e.g. find that right after breakfast my child is very relaxed and starts playing by himself. There is then free space that I use directly to work. Then I notice (very different depending on age and type) that my child starts to come into contact with me after 30 minutes. An example of this is e.g. that it has to go to the toilet and doesn't want to go alone or want my opinion on many parts of my game. In that case, I stop my work and devote myself to my child. Maybe we can playfully clean up breakfast with priority on the shared time aspect. Then I know from past experience that e.g. Reading aloud now feels good and read a book aloud. This creates an independent game for the child and I can get back to my work.

Depending on how starved my child is for my attention, it can take some time before it feels that my basic attitude is "child before work" and that I see and pay attention to it. If you pay attention to the process, take care of things and then work, you can develop a very cozy atmosphere in the home office of togetherness with children. This is neither a simple nor a short-term process and in the beginning it will often not work or breakfast will stay at the table all day.

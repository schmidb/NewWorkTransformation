    <!-- Practical New Work - accompanying a cultural change -->
<p>In order to lead your company successfully into the future, a cultural change in the direction of “New Work” is a promising path.</p>

<h4 id="what-does-new-work-mean-in-brief-in-this-case">What does “New Work” mean in brief in this case?</h4>
<p>For us, New Work stands for a corporate culture that offers its employees an environment in which they are motivated to give their best performance based on their skills and independently. For the company this has many important advantages for the future:</p>

<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> efficiently working employees </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> reduced employee turnover </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> more flexible and therefore shorter reaction times to changes in the market thanks to the high level of personal responsibility of the employees </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> fewer sick days for employees </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-do-we-come-to-this-culture">How do we come to this culture?</h4>
<p>First of all, it is important to recognize that cultural change takes time. A period of 5 to 10 years is realistic. A culture change is a growing process that cannot simply be decided upon.
It starts with a clear vision of the culture that is sought to be developed and internalized throughout the company.
Only when every member of the company knows what is being strived for does everyone have the opportunity to identify what is expedient in their area.</p>

<p>It is fundamentally important as a company to be flexible in order to be able to respond to the rapid changes in the market.
This includes offering different work models, viewing self-responsible work as the norm, treating the personal circumstances of employees with respect and taking energy-guzzling emotions such as fear, envy, stress and boredom seriously.</p>

<p>We offer a number of workshops that are tailored to your specific requirements:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col s12 m12">
    <div class="card blue-grey darken-1">
      <div class="card-content white-text">
        <span class="card-title">Remote Culture Workshops</span>
        <p>
        The year 2020 was formative for the work culture due to the Corona Pandemic. In 2021, the government's rules will lead to an expansion of home or remote work. This brings many new challenges for companies, individuals and families. Based on our 10 years of experience, we have developed a range of offerings to help companies and individuals at home.

        <p>
        We offer a number of workshops that are tailored to your specific requirements and recommend at least two weeks of workshops each year to accompany your cultural change. We would be happy to guide you in your culture change or train your in-house cultural guides so that they can shape their own cultural change independently of us.
